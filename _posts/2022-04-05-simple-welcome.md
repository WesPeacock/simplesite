This is a simple post to illustrate a bit of Jekyll.

The next two lines should be in different fonts
* This bullet point is in the default minima font. The next point should be in Google Gentium Basic webfont
* <span class="nkonya">Nɔ́pʋ Gugɛl Gyɛntiam Besɩk wɛbfɔnt wanlɩn ɩ́nɩ.</span>

That's all for this post.
